Code Controller is an open source, immediate GUI tool that is mainly aimed for the development phase of creative or visual applications. The main focus of the project are ease of use and overhead zeroing while trying to (1) provide powerful tools to control and debug a live program, (2) minimizing creative iterations, (3) be portable between different platforms and frameworks.

The project is still in development and will include additional features. The core functionality will probably remain, although some major design changes and few bug fixed are still required.
